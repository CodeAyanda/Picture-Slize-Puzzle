# Picture-Slize-Puzzle

A sliding puzzle, sliding block puzzle, or sliding tile puzzle is a combination puzzle that challenges a player to slide (frequently flat) pieces along certain routes (usually on a board) to establish a certain end-configuration. The pieces to be moved may consist of simple shapes, or they may be imprinted with colours, patterns, sections of a larger picture (like a jigsaw puzzle), numbers, or letters.

The game has all the picture pieces as objects.
Each piece knows its image and number in the sequence.
Clicking on the image next to the blank square swaps the image and blank piece.
Implemented a shuffle method that shuffles pieces by a given number of times.
Can change the number of pieces but changing num in Form1.cs (num x num board)
Can use custom image (make sure image is 1:1, make sure imgSize in Form1 is the image width or height)
